[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) provider for VMware vCloud Director®
=============

[Version 0.1.0](https://github.com/frapposelli/vagrant-vcloud/releases/tag/v0.1.0) has been released!
-------------

Please note that this software is still Alpha/Beta quality and is not recommended for production usage.

Right now a [Precise32](http://vagrant.tsugliani.fr/precise32.box) is available for use, or you can roll your own as you please, make sure to install VMware tools in it.

Features of Version 0.1.0 are:

- Basic Create/Provision/Destroy lifecycle.
- Rsync-based provisioning (working on alternatives for that).
- Use a single vApp as a container for Multi-VM Vagrantfiles.
- Use a vApp vShield Edge to perform DNAT/SNAT on a single IP for Multi-VM Vagrantfiles.
- Automatically create NAT rules on a fronting Organization Edge.
- Automatic upload of the Vagrant box to the specified catalog.
- Works on [vCloud® Hybrid Service™](http://www.vmware.com/products/vcloud-hybrid-service)!

What is still missing:

- TEST SUITES! (working on that).
- Speed, the code is definitely not optimized.
- Permission checks, make sure you have at least Catalog Admin privileges if you want to upload boxes to vCloud.
- Thorough testing.
- Error checking is absymal.
- Some spaghetti code here and there.
- Bugs, bugs and BUGS!.

If you're a developer and want to lend us a hand, head over to our ```develop``` branch and get busy!

Install
-------------

Version 0.1.0 can be easily installed by running:

```vagrant plugin install vagrant-vcloud```

Vagrant will download all the required gems during the installation process.

After the install has completed a ```vagrant up --provider=vcloud``` will trigger the newly installed provider.

Here's a sample Multi-VM Vagrantfile, please note that ```vcloud.vdc_edge_gateway``` and ```vcloud.vdc_edge_gateway_ip``` are required only when you cannot access ```vcloud.vdc_network_name``` directly and there's an Organization Edge between your workstation and the vCloud Network.

```ruby
